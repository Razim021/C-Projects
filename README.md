# C-Projects
# File System & AVL Tree Database in C++

## Overview
This repository contains two C++ projects that demonstrate advanced data structures and efficient algorithmic implementations:

- **In-Memory File System**: A hierarchical file system using tree data structures.
- **AVL Tree-Based Database**: A database management system utilizing an AVL tree for optimized operations.

Both projects focus on **performance, memory management, and structured data handling**.

## Features

### 🗂️ In-Memory File System
- **Directory & File Management** – Supports `mkdir`, `touch`, `cd`, and `rm` commands.
- **Navigation & Path Resolution** – Implements `pwd` for directory path retrieval and `ls` for listing contents.
- **Recursive Search & Hierarchical Display** – Supports `find` for locating files and `tree` for structured visualization.
- **Memory Optimization** – Efficient dynamic allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks.

### 🌳 AVL Tree-Based Database
- **Self-Balancing AVL Tree** – Ensures `O(log n)` efficiency for insert, delete, and search operations.
- **Balanced Rotations** – Implements **left, right, left-right, and right-left** rotations.
- **Dynamic Record Management** – Supports inserting, deleting, and updating database records.
- **Range Queries & Indexing** – Enables optimized search for sorted data retrieval.
- **Memory & Performance Optimization** – Prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient storage utilization.
